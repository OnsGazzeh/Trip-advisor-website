        <h3>Sousse</h3>
        <p>Sousse is a sizeable city of around 173,000 inhabitants, about 140km south of Tunisia’s capital city, Tunis.
            Located on the coast in the central east of the country, it borders the Gulf of Hammamet which is part of the Mediterranean Sea. </p>
           <h3>History</h3>
            <p>Sousse has a long history, dating back over 2,800 years, and has a great deal of character.
           It was developed in the 1960s as a tourist destination and now has a great deal to offer from its historic Old Town and Medina
            to the busy port and local sandy beaches..</p>
            <h3>The Medina</h3>
            <p>
                The medina of Sousse is a pleasure to visit in many ways. 
                Although it is not very large by Tunisian standards, it’s charming, relaxed and one of the finest 
                in Tunisia for tourists to visit. Most of the old city’s alleyways are covered, either by tiles, ceiling 
                girders or huge supportive eaves. Hustling these days is not a problem as it was in the medina, and women 
                can walk around safely and easily (however please be aware of snach and grab crime). Sousse previously had a
                 well-deserved reputation of being a place where the shopkeepers will con you no matter what you buy, 
                 but that is no longer true, as more and more shops have fixed, and reasonable, prices (see article on shopping in Sousse).</p>
